# A Smart System to Find Parking Spaces

## Project Overview
We all have had that conversation at some point in time where we either say or hear “Sorry, I can’t come to that place. It’s very difficult to find a parking space there”.

This is where parking apps come into the role. This apps perform the cumbersome task of finding near-by empty parking spaces and app users just need to reach there and park. 

### Note
 This is the administration module of the parking spot finder application. If you are interested in the client application, visit this link : https://github.com/AndroidCSPROJECT/ParkingFinder
